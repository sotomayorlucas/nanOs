## The NanOS Way

In the spirit of our swarm philosophy:

> *"In the swarm, no cell is special. Every cell is essential."*

We believe that:

- **Diversity strengthens the swarm**: Different backgrounds and perspectives make our community stronger
- **Collaboration over competition**: We succeed together
- **Learning is continuous**: Everyone is at a different stage, and that's okay
- **Mistakes are opportunities**: We all make errors; what matters is how we learn from them
- **Respect is fundamental**: Treat others as you wish to be treated

Thank you for helping make NanOS a welcoming community for all.
